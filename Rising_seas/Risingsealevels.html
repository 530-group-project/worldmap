                <h2>Sea levels?</h2>
                <p>Global Sea levels have been steadly rising every year because of the increase in temperature. The rise in temperature causes thermal expansion because water expands as it warms and there is also the melthing in-land ice. Another problem is the Local rising sea levels because depending on where a person live the rise may be more significant then the Global average.</p>

                <h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>
                <p>The continued warming of the atmosphere and water will rise the sea level at a higher rate than it is now. According to the <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html#:~:text=Global%20sea%20level%20has%20been,of%20an%20inch%20per%20year.">National Ocean Service(NOS)</a> almost 40% of the U.S population lives in high-population-density coastal areas. Globally eight of the largest cities are located near the coast. The rise of sea levels may differ locally as some local areas are more affected than others.</p>

                <h2>Events caused by Higher sea levels</h2>
                <p>A lot of major events will happen because of higher sea levels. There will be more deadly and destructive storm surges happening further inland than before. Many places that are susceptible to flooding will have more frequent high tide flooding or "nuisance" flooding. These types of flooding are usually disruptive and expensive which will affect taxpayers as their money may have to go toward damages that could have been avoided. According to the NOS, within 50 years flooding has happened 300-900% more frequent in the U.S coast.</p>
